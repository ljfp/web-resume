            <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
            <h3>RLEngine: a video game engine for roguelikes</h3>
            <p>August 2022 - Present | <a href="https://github.com/ljfp/RLEngine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing a C++ video game engine designed for creating roguelike games based on the Berlin Interpretation of the genre. The engine incorporates an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture using Flecs, providing flexible and efficient game object management. Testing shows the engine can handle tens of thousands of entities per frame with minimal impact.</li>
                <li>Integrated multiple technologies, including GLM for linear algebra, spdlog for logging, SDL2 for keyboard, audio, and window management, Vulkan for rendering, and Lua bindings for game scripts.</li>
                <li>Supporting cross-platform functionality for Linux and Windows, with build times of approximately 1m33s using 6 cores/12 threads on both systems, ensuring fast and efficient development cycles across platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cscheme: a single-pass compiler with an interactive interpreter (REPL) for Scheme</h3>
            <p>August 2024 - Present | <a href="https://github.com/ljfp/cscheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing a C-based single-pass compiler for Scheme (R7RS), repurposing the "clox" compiler built from the book Crafting Interpreters. This involves adapting the design for functional language support and creating an efficient compilation pipeline.</li>
                <li>Implementing Pratt's Parsing to handle Scheme's syntax, enabling flexible parsing for expressions and control structures. The parser efficiently manages prefix and infix operations, making the compilation process streamlined.</li>
                <li>Optimizing memory management and performance using techniques such as garbage collection and tail-call optimization, ensuring efficient handling of Scheme’s recursion and functional constructs within the constraints of a single-pass compiler.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <h3>Game Server Developer (C++) - AzerothCore</h3>
            <p>August 2021 - Present | Remote (Worldwide)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contributed code to "AzerothCore", a C++ open-source MMORPG game server based on World of Warcraft v3.3.5a. Added RBAC, fixed spells, cleaned up database entries, and improved CI with GitHub Actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Game Client Developer (C++) - DevilutionX</h3>
                <p>August 2021 - Present | Remote (Worldwide)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contributed code for DevilutionX: a modern C++ port of Diablo and Hellfire, cross-compiled to run on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, PS4, Xbox 360, 3DS, Switch). Fixed multiplayer TCP parser bug, added a cinematic "skip" button for the 3DS build, and refactored classes to meet BetterCodeHub standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Software Engineer (Infrastructure) - Medallia</h3>
            <p>April 2020 - July 2024 | San Francisco, USA (Remote)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed and implemented a batch REST API using Python (Flask) and Redis to create Kubernetes jobs on demand, handling the creation of ~10k jobs per day. The system tracks job progress and updates a custom database built with C++ and Boost to store results. Implemented an optimized bucket-sort algorithm to distribute load between shards of the same job, reducing execution times.</li>
                <li>Built a web application with Flask, React, and Elasticsearch to display the results of ~1000 tests in near real-time, providing detailed logs and trace-backs for errors in failed tests.</li>
                <li>Created a system testing framework, tailored to Medallia’s main product, featuring a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing tests. Trained peers on the DSL and best practices for writing tests within the framework.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Site Reliability Engineer (Monitoring Systems) - Netrix Global</h3>
            <p>March 2018 - March 2020 | Buenos Aires, Argentina - Las Vegas, USA</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deployed, maintained, and enhanced an open-source monitoring system written in Golang (Sensu-go) for cloud and on-premises infrastructures, processing ~1000 time-series metrics every 6 seconds and handling the respective alerts.</li>
                <li>Developed a high-performance application in C++ to process ~1M HTTP requests per hour via a Protobuf stream, tag requests, and re-send the properly tagged requests to a time-series database (InfluxDB) for storage and analysis.</li>
                <li>Architected a CI/CD flow for updating monitoring clients across multiple hosts and data centers, using Ansible with Python and shell scripts for configuration. GitHub Actions triggered the Ansible playbook when merging a PR to a selected branch, automating the update process and streamlining deployment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>DevOps Engineer (Automations) - Arbusta</h3>
            <p>January 2016 - February 2018 | Buenos Aires, Argentina</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed and deployed a tracking system using Python and AWS (Boto3) to manage testing environments, customers, and applications for each release, reducing manual effort and increasing cross-team visibility.</li>
                <li>Standardized the integration testing process by implementing Jenkins pipelines, reducing deployment times by 67% (from 4 hours to 1 hour 20 minutes) through the use of parallel pipelines and automation. Transformed a manual deployment process into an automated, documented system using Jenkinsfiles, improving project consistency.</li>
                <li>Automated the provisioning and management of infrastructure using Docker and Terraform, creating reliable and repeatable test environments. Eliminated manual labor by developing an infrastructure-as-code approach, enhancing productivity and reproducibility.</li>
            </ul>
